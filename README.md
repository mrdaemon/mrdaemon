Hello
-----

I am some guy on the internet who makes tools that teach computers to do computer things on other computers.

You can find here:

* Some random automation
* Docker containers for random stuff, mostly game servers
* Plenty of unfinished projects
* Horrifying Unix configuration files

I can also be found on <a rel="me" href="https://untrusted.website/@mr_daemon">Mastodon</a>.

mrdaemon/mrdaemon is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
